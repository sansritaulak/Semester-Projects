# Semester Projects Repository

Welcome to my semester projects repository! This repository contains the code, documentation, and research related to the projects I completed during my academic semester. Each project reflects my journey in learning, exploring, and applying computational concepts to real-world problems.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Breast Cancer Prediction
#### Objective
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on given features.

#### Highlights
- **Dataset**: Used the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Techniques**: Implemented feature engineering, data preprocessing, and various classification algorithms.
- **Results**: Achieved high accuracy using models like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.
- **Skills**: Model evaluation, data visualization, and deployment.

#### Files
- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`: Code implementation.
- `data/`: Dataset files.
- `results/`: Model performance metrics and visualizations.

### 2. Document-Based Question Answering System Using LangChain
#### Objective
Developed a question-answering system that retrieves answers from a set of documents using LangChain.

#### Highlights
- **Libraries**: LangChain, OpenAI API, and other NLP tools.
- **Features**: Extractive and generative Q&A capabilities.
- **Use Case**: Designed for applications like academic research and knowledge retrieval systems.
- **Skills**: Text embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and API integration.

#### Files
- `doc_qa_system.ipynb`: Code for the system.
- `documents/`: Sample documents used for testing.
- `readme.md`: Details about setting up and using the system.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of LDA, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
#### Objective
Conducted a comparative analysis of dimensionality reduction techniques to understand their applications, strengths, and weaknesses.

#### Highlights
- **Techniques**: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).
- **Dataset**: Analyzed using multidimensional datasets.
- **Comparisons**: Evaluated based on visualization quality, computational cost, and clustering effectiveness.
- **Skills**: Data visualization, high-dimensional data analysis.

#### Files
- `dimensionality_reduction_analysis.ipynb`: Code for implementation and visualization.
- `data/`: Multidimensional datasets used in the analysis.
- `results/`: Plots and comparative metrics.
