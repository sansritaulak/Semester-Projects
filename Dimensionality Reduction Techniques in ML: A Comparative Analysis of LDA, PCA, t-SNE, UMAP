Introduction:  
High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common in various fields, including bioinformatics, image processing, and finance. While these datasets offer rich insights, they present challenges such as increased computational costs, overfitting, and difficulty in visualizing data. Dimensionality reduction techniques help address these issues by simplifying data while preserving its essential structure. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have become standard tools, but each comes with unique strengths and limitations. Understanding how these techniques differ and when to use them is critical for effective machine learning.


Objective:  
Analyze the mathematical principles and performance of PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and LDA.
Compare their scalability, effectiveness, and interpretability across different data types and tasks.

Problem Statement:  
The challenge lies in determining which dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP is best suited for specific high-dimensional datasets, balancing factors like computational efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability. This seminar aims to provide a comparative analysis of these techniques, offering insights into their strengths, limitations, and optimal use cases in machine learning.

Methodology:  

Literature Review:  
The study will begin with an in-depth review of existing research and papers on PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and LDA. This review will cover both theoretical developments and practical applications in various fields. The goal is to understand the mathematical foundations behind each method and the contexts in which they perform best. This will help establish a framework for comparing the techniques.

Theoretical Comparison:  
The core mathematical concepts behind each technique will be explored, such as eigenvalue decomposition for PCA, probabilistic modeling for t-SNE, and manifold learning for UMAP. This comparison will focus on factors like scalability, complexity, and the linear versus non-linear nature of each method.

Empirical Evaluation:  
Each technique will be applied to various datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, and text-based datasets) to assess performance. Metrics such as computational time, accuracy will be evaluated. This empirical evaluation will help identify which method is most suitable for specific types of high-dimensional data.

Expected Outcomes:  
A detailed comparison of PCA, t-SNE, UMAP and LDA, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and computational trade-offs.
A deeper understanding of the mathematical principles behind each technique and how they impact real-world machine learning performance.
